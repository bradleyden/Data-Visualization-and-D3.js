# Data Visualization with D3.js

This talk will cover the basics of data visualization and how it relates
to web development. It will serve as an introduction to D3.js and SVG and
how these tools relate to create impressive visualizations from data.

## Prerequisites

-   HTML

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Explain what data visualization is and why it's an important
    part of web development.
-   Define SVG and use it to create basic shapes on a webpage.
-   Explain the advantages of SVG over bitmap images.
-   Install D3.js and its related modules to be used in a project.
-   Explain the basics of data binding.

## Preparation

1.  Just follow along!

## What is Data Visualization?

From Wikipedia:

Data visualization or data visualisation is viewed by many disciplines as a modern equivalent of visual communication. It involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data, meaning "information that has been abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or variables for the units of information".

A primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently via statistical graphics, plots and information graphics. Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message. Effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence. It makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable. Users may have particular analytical tasks, such as making comparisons or understanding causality, and the design principle of the graphic (i.e., showing comparisons or showing causality) follows the task. Tables are generally used where users will look up a specific measurement, while charts of various types are used to show patterns or relationships in the data for one or more variables.

Data visualization is both an art and a science. It is viewed as a branch of descriptive statistics by some, but also as a grounded theory development tool by others. Increased amounts of data created by Internet activity and an expanding number of sensors in the environment are referred to as "big data" or Internet of things. Processing, analyzing and communicating this data present ethical and analytical challenges for data visualization. The field of data science and practitioners called data scientists help address this challenge
